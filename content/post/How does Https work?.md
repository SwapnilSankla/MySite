Below card depicts how Https works. 

There are two parts. First part is Certificate generation. 
Certificates can be either self-signed or issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs). Obtaining 
certificate from CA is mandatory to allow clients to connect to application securely over Internet.
Self-signed certificate are mostly used during testing.

The second part is, how certificate is used while establishing a secure connection between a client 
and the server.
